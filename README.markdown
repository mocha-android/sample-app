# Mocha Sample App

Simple sample app for Mocha that shows how to structure a project and work with table views and collection views.

## Using with Android Studio

The sample app (and Mocha itself) require the gradle build system.

 1. Clone the repository: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/mocha-android/sample-app.git`
 2. In Android Studio, go to **File > Import Project** and select the `sample-app` directory
 3. Once the import is finished (Android Studio may want to reload the project), you should be able to build + run
 4. Explore, break things, and hopefully submit a few pull requests :)
